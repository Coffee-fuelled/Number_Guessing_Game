Guessing Game Testing

Manual Tests
What needs to be tested:
1. Handles non number input for guess.
2. Ends on 5 guesses but last valid guess works correcty.
3. Ends correctly any time the correct guess is input.
4. Handles 5 incorrect guesses correctly.
5. Hint works correctly.

How to test:  - some tests can be carried out concurrently!
1. Try non number input - should warn user and start turn again.

2. Change number to be guessed to fixed number. 
	Try 4 incorrect guesses then the 5th guess correct, the game should handle this as correct answer.

3. Stay with fixed number.
	Try the correct number at several different guess counts.
	
4. Stay with fixed number. 
	Try 5 incorrect guesses, the game should handle this correctly with "better luck next time" etc.
	
5. Stay with fixed number. 
	Can be done with test 4 - 
	select the h or H and see if the result is correct. Change the guess higher or lower than the fixed number.
	Try both h and H.
--- Note ----
*** Don't forget to change back from fixed number****

Unit Tests:
1. guess class test - test correct input - manually test reactions to incorrect inputs
2. game class test - correct number first try
3. game class test - incorrect number with count set to 4
4. game class test - correct number with count at 4
